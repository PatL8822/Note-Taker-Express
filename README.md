# Note-Taker-Express
## Description

I am attempting to create a simple note taker using node.js express
as my data storage. Trying to understand express further in depth was the motivation behind this app. When completed it will solve being able to take notes online with ease. The learning curve with express is steep and is very difficult. What I learned is how to identify middle wair, end points and the transition from front end to back end.
